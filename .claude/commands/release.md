description: Friday release ritual — create git tag, GitHub release (auto-generated changelog), and a customer-facing email draft (Cal.com style)
allowed-tools: Bash, Write, Read, Skill
---

You are running the Friday release ritual for TryPost. Three artifacts are produced:

1. A git tag (semver)
2. A GitHub release with the **auto-generated** changelog (PR list + authors via GitHub's native generator — flat, technical, for developers)
3. A **customer-facing email draft** in Cal.com style (themed prose, end-user voice, no commit/PR references)

Plus local mirrors in `releases/<version>/`.

**Always confirm with the user before any push/tag/release.**

## Context (auto-loaded)

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Working tree: !`git status --porcelain`
- Latest tag: !`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "(none)"`
- Repo (owner/name): !`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null || echo "(no gh)"`
- Local vs origin/main: !`git fetch --quiet origin main 2>/dev/null; git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main 2>/dev/null || echo "0	0"`
- Commits since latest tag (or all if no tag): !`LAST_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null); if [ -z "$LAST_TAG" ]; then git log --pretty=format:"%H%x09%s" --reverse; else git log "$LAST_TAG"..HEAD --pretty=format:"%H%x09%s" --reverse; fi`

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Pre-flight checks

Stop and tell the user if any of these fail:

- Current branch must be `main`. Else: ask user to `git checkout main`.
- Working tree must be clean. Else: ask user to commit/stash.
- Local in sync with `origin/main` (rev-list count `0	0`). Else: ask user to pull/push.
- Commits-since-tag list must be non-empty. Else: "Nada novo desde a última tag."

### Step 2 — Determine next version

TryPost uses **sequential numbering with rollover at 9** — not standard semver. Do not parse conventional commits to choose the bump. Every release is the next sequential number, whatever the commits look like.

1. If no previous tag exists → next version = **`v1.0.0`** (first release ever).
2. Otherwise, parse the latest tag as `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and increment by these rules:
   - `patch += 1`
   - If `patch` reaches `10`: set `patch = 0`, `minor += 1`
   - If `minor` reaches `10`: set `minor = 0`, `major += 1`
3. Re-prefix with `v`.

Examples:

| From | To |
|---|---|
| (no tag) | v1.0.0 |
| v1.0.0 | v1.0.1 |
| v1.0.8 | v1.0.9 |
| v1.0.9 | v1.1.0 |
| v1.5.7 | v1.5.8 |
| v1.9.8 | v1.9.9 |
| v1.9.9 | v2.0.0 |

There is no manual override — the next version is whatever the rule above produces. If a release needs a different version for some special reason, the user must create the tag manually outside this command.

### Step 3 — Preview the changelog (GitHub native format)

Use GitHub's release-notes generator API to produce the changelog **without creating anything yet**:

```bash
gh api -X POST "repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/releases/generate-notes" \
  -f tag_name="<new_version>" \
  -f target_commitish="main" \
  -f previous_tag_name="<latest_tag>" \
  --jq '.body'
```

For the first release ever (no previous tag), omit the `previous_tag_name` flag — GitHub falls back to the initial commit.

The body already contains:
- `<subject> by @<author> in #<PR>` lines
- "New Contributors" section when applicable
- `Full Changelog: ...` compare link

**Do not modify it.** The GitHub-native format is the goal.

### Step 4 — Draft the customer email (Cal.com style)

This email is for **end users of TryPost** — non-developers, paying customers, trial users. It must **NOT** reference: commits, PRs, authors, SHAs, conventional commit scopes, version control concepts, internal class names, file paths.

Read the commits only as **internal source material**. Translate to user-facing language.

#### Structure

```markdown
---
subject: "Changelog <version> — <theme 1>, <theme 2>, <theme 3>..."
---

# Changelog <version> — <theme 1>, <theme 2>, <theme 3>...

By TryPost Product Team • [Release <version>](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/releases/tag/<version>)

Hello! Welcome to this week's update. Here's what's new in TryPost.

## <Theme 1>

<2-4 sentences of concrete narrative — what changed, why a user should care, what they'll notice. No marketing puffery.>

## <Theme 2>

<same>

## <Theme 3 — only if there are genuinely 3 themes worth of work>

<same>

## New features

- <user-facing one-liner — what they can now do>
- <...>

## Fixes

- <user-facing one-liner — what no longer breaks>
- <...>

Cheers,
Paulo from TryPost.it

You're receiving this because you subscribed.
[Unsubscribe]({{unsubscribe_url}})
```

**Always link the GitHub release from the byline** — make `Release <version>` a link to `https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/releases/tag/<version>` (as shown above). It gives developer-minded readers the raw PR-level changelog without cluttering the body.

**Always end with the unsubscribe footer** — the `---` separator, the "You're receiving this because you subscribed." line, and an `[Unsubscribe]({{unsubscribe_url}})` link below the signature. Keep `{{unsubscribe_url}}` as a literal placeholder; the email sending tool fills it in. This footer is required on every customer email.

#### Theme grouping (AI clusters by user impact)

Read all commits since the last tag and cluster into **2-3 user-facing themes**. Use whatever frame makes the changes feel coherent to a customer, not to a developer.

**Good themes** (end-user framing):
- "Trial protection" — bundles billing/Stripe Radar work
- "Reliable Facebook posting" — bundles Facebook fixes
- "Faster scheduling" — bundles queue/post improvements
- "Better post editor" — bundles UI changes to the post composer

**Bad themes** (internal framing — never use these):
- "Refactoring"
- "Dependency updates"
- "Feature commits" / "Fix commits"
- "Backend improvements"

If there are fewer than 3 themeable groups, use 2 or just 1. Don't pad. Internal-only changes (chore, CI, refactor, deps) usually shouldn't appear at all — fold the user-visible ones into "Fixes" with a user-voice rewrite, drop the rest.

#### Bullet rules for "New features" / "Fixes"

Rewrite each item in **user voice**, not commit voice:

- ❌ "fix(facebook): send Graph API requests as form-urlencoded"
- ✅ "Fixed an issue where multi-image Facebook posts could fail to publish"

- ❌ "feat(billing): charge one-time trial setup fee at Stripe Checkout"
- ✅ (Probably its own theme, not a bullet — billing is a big user-facing topic)

- ❌ "chore(deps): bump axios to 1.13.5"
- ✅ (Skip entirely — pure internal)

If a commit has no user-visible effect, **omit it**. Don't pad the email.

#### Subject line

Pattern: `Changelog <version> — <theme 1>, <theme 2>, <theme 3>...`

Don't put "TryPost" in the subject — the email already comes from the TryPost sender, so it's redundant.

Cap around 80 chars. If themes don't fit, shorten to the 2 most impactful + "and more...".

### Step 5 — Humanize the email prose

Run the email body through the `humanizer` skill before previewing:

1. Invoke the `Skill` tool with `skill: humanizer` and pass the draft email body plus this context: *"This is a customer-facing changelog email for TryPost (social media scheduler SaaS). Tone: developer founder writing to early users on a Friday — warm, specific, no marketing puffery. Cal.com style. Keep the existing structure (subject frontmatter, section headers, bullets, signature, unsubscribe footer). Do not strip section headers, the 'Cheers, Paulo from TryPost.it' signature, or the unsubscribe footer."*
2. Replace the draft email body with the humanized version.

**Do NOT humanize:**
- The changelog from Step 3 (flat commit list, no prose).
- The subject line frontmatter.
- The literal signature `Cheers,\nPaulo from TryPost.it` — keep it exact.
- The unsubscribe footer (`---`, "You're receiving this because you subscribed.", `[Unsubscribe]({{unsubscribe_url}})`) — keep it exact, below the signature.

The humanizer skill itself covers all patterns. Trust it.

### Step 6 — Confirm with the user

Show:
1. **Proposed version** (e.g., `v1.0.9 → v1.1.0` — sequential rollover at 9).
2. **Changelog preview** (Step 3 output).
3. **Email preview**: subject line + full body (post-humanizer).
4. **Files that will be created/pushed**:
   - Tag `<version>` (pushed to origin)
   - GitHub release `<version>`
   - `releases/<version>/changelog.md`
   - `releases/<version>/email.md`

Then ask in Portuguese: **"Crio a tag, publico o release e salvo os arquivos?"**

Do **not** proceed without explicit yes.

### Step 7 — Execute

After confirmation, in this exact order:

1. Create local directory: `mkdir -p releases/<version>`
2. Write `releases/<version>/changelog.md` with the Step 3 content (raw GitHub markdown).
3. Write `releases/<version>/email.md` with frontmatter + humanized body.
4. Create annotated tag: `git tag -a <version> -m "Release <version>"`
5. Push tag: `git push origin <version>`
6. Create the GitHub release using the changelog file as body:
   ```bash
   gh release create <version> --title "<version>" --notes-file releases/<version>/changelog.md
   ```
7. Report to the user:
   - GitHub release URL (from `gh` output)
   - Local paths: `releases/<version>/changelog.md`, `releases/<version>/email.md`
   - Reminder: *"Os arquivos em `releases/<version>/` não foram commitados. Commit depois se quiser preservar o histórico no repo."*

### On failure

- `git push origin <version>` fails: report the exact error, leave the local tag in place, do not retry destructively.
- `gh release create` fails: the tag is already pushed; tell the user they can recreate manually with `gh release create <version> --title "<version>" --notes-file releases/<version>/changelog.md`.
- `Skill` or `Write` failure during artifact prep: report and stop. Do not push the tag without the artifacts being prepared.
